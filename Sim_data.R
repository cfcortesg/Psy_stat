##### Simulation data

#In this simulation data we need:
# n = obs
# n_it = number of items
# b = difficulty parameter in rasch model (grid)
# n_dif = number of items with DIF
# p = probability of being referenced or focal group

#In this case the item with dif is the one where de difference in difficulty (b parameter in Rasch Model) 
#between the refence and focal group is random()
#We asume discrimination is the same (Rasch) and the two groups, balanced or unbalanced, have the same hability distribution 

sim_data = function(n, b){
